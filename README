This code is supplied as an example implementation to make clear the ideas expressed in my submitted manuscript "Understanding Node Spreading Power: A Continuous Time Perspective."

No liscence is given to use this code or any of its algorithms in any project without the explicit permission of the author. I regret the need to be so strict. The reason is that the code was written as part of my employment. We are having ongoing discussion as to how best make the code and algorithms expressed therein available to others. 

We do not give any warranty or expression of fitness for any purpose.
