All code and algorithms copyright Glenn Lawyer, 2013.

This code is supplied as an example implementation to make clear the ideas expressed in my manuscript "Understanding the spreading power of all nodes in a network: a continuous-time perspective."

No lisence is given to use this code or any algorithms expressed in this code in any commercial project without the explicit permission of the author. I regret the need to be so strict. The reason is that the code was written as part of my employment. We are having ongoing discussion as to how best make the code and algorithms expressed therein available to others. 

We do not give any warranty or expression of fitness for any purpose.

If you are reviewing the manuscript and are interested in the timing results, please be aware of the following. As the code here shows, simply moving the loops from R to C++ gives a several order of magnitude speedup. But even the C++ code here first calls into Igraph to extract the local neighborhood, then has to re-convert this subgraph to a C++ structure before calculating the ExF. 

I get several more orders of magnitude of speed when I store the whole network in custom C++ code. Timing comparisons to the K-shell and eigenvalue centrality are based on such a graph. Forgive that I don't share that code here; mostly this is embarassment on my part as it is still in a very active development stage and there is a high risk of zombies.
